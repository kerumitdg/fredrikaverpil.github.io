Throughout the years I have been spending my professional life within the digital domain of creativity and programming; from web site design/development to 3D animation and digital visual effects for feature films. With professional experience within the field of 3D graphics since 2005, including co-founding [Filmgate](http://www.filmgate.se) and developing the pipeline at [Industriromantik](http://www.industriromantik.se), I now take part in an extraordinary team of talent at [Volvo Group](https://www.volvogroup.com) as Embedded Software Integration Engineer.
